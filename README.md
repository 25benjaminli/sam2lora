Simple implementation of low rank adaptation for [Segment Anything 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2)

Inspiration comes from [this repository](https://github.com/JamesQFreeman/Sam_LoRA)

You should be able to use this implementation out of the box although the code is in development so please report any issues!
